# FoosTrack

A simple PHP app to manage foosball matches, scores, and player stats.

## Live Demo

You can try the project live here:

⚠️ Please note:  
This app is hosted on Render’s free tier. If it hasn’t been accessed in a while, the server needs to "wake up", which can cause delays of up to **50 seconds** on the first request.

Also: Currently, the app does **not include a database** – player data and matches are not yet stored persistently. A proper database (e.g. MySQL or SQLite) is planned for a future update.

## Goals (MVP)

- Create matches (1vs1 and 2vs2)
- Add players and track their performance
- View match history
- Show a ranking table

## Tech Stack

- PHP
- MySQL (or SQLite) – planned
- HTML/CSS (possibly Bootstrap)
